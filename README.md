# Digital-Image-Processing---Shortest-Path
This project consists of processing some images which simulate a labyrinth to find the shortest path (left to right). When it finds the right path, it paints a red line on the image.

How images were made:
  
   The images were made with a white paper and the lines with a black pen. However, if you want to test it with your own images, you can use any color, but its important to use a white paper. If the paper's color and the pen's color are too close (on grayscale for ex.: Paper: 220, Pen: 200) the program maybe will find an error when binarizes it. After taking the photo, it's important to  use the right size too. Length 512 to 1024 pixels and height between 256 e 768 pixels. Also important to clarify that images are arrays so if the image has more than 5mb, the program will run through some problems. You can also use synthetic image.
